# Urbanlytics Datathon

This time series prediction question was presented during the [2019 Urbanlytics Datathon](https://www.axiata.com/urbanlytics/).

## Problem Statement

Air quality is one of the major concerns among Malaysians and air sensors are deployed across Cyberjaya to measure air quality. Using data from one of the air sensors stored in “air_sensor.json”, build a model to forecast air quality (pm25) from 2019-07-01 to 2019-07-07 on an hourly interval from 0000 to 2300 for each day.
